This is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe with a twist to it.
A bet/ wager is set and players decide whether to accept the bet or not.
Accepting the terms and conditions of the game simply means that they have given 
the rights over to the smart contract and therefore pay the ammount set to a middle account(deployers account)
Upon winning, the money placed as a bet is doubled and sent back to the winners account.
